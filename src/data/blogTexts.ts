## My Journey to Finding My Love for Coding

I started my Computer Engineering degree in September 2022.
Like most students in my program, the first language they taught us was C++.
But honestly‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt like it at all. It just didn‚Äôt click with me.

Around that time, social media was full of people saying, "Python is the best language to start with!"
So, I decided to give it a try. I jumped from one Python course to another ‚Äî four different courses in a single year ‚Äî hoping to finally connect with it.
Eventually, I thought, "Alright, maybe Django is the next step."
But I hated it. I mean‚Ä¶ really **hated** it.

I was completely lost. I didn‚Äôt know what direction to take anymore.
I couldn‚Äôt write code without relying on AI to basically do it for me.
By July 2023, I decided to quit Python altogether.

I reached out to several ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù programmers for advice.
But instead of guiding me selflessly, most of them tried to push me toward their own paths, their own languages, or even their own work projects.
That wasn‚Äôt what I wanted.
I wasn‚Äôt looking for someone else‚Äôs dream ‚Äî I wanted to find *my* dream.
I wanted to discover a programming language I could truly fall in love with.

After a month away from coding, I told myself:
*"Come on, Nastaran‚Ä¶ at least learn HTML. It‚Äôs better than nothing. No matter which language you end up using, HTML will be useful."*

So, I opened YouTube, found the **Bro Code** HTML course, and started.
To my surprise‚Ä¶ I found it *incredibly* interesting!
Naturally, the next step was styling.
I told myself:
*"It‚Äôs just a 6-hour CSS course, Nastaran. Don‚Äôt be lazy. You can do this."*

I finished the CSS course in a single day.
And I loved every second of it.

Then I started doing small HTML + CSS projects I found on YouTube.
But many of them needed a bit of JavaScript for buttons or animations.
In the videos, the creators would say:
*"Don‚Äôt worry about learning this part ‚Äî just copy the <script></script> code."*

But I didn‚Äôt want to just copy it.
I wanted to *understand* it.

That‚Äôs when I found a **90-hour JavaScript course** on an Iranian platform called **SabzLearn**.
It was divided into three parts: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.
The beginner section was only 10 hours, so I thought:
*"Perfect. This should cover all the basics I need for those small projects."*

But by the end of that week‚Ä¶ I was already halfway through the intermediate section.
I had fallen *completely* in love with JavaScript.

I loved everything about it ‚Äî the logic, the creativity, the possibilities.
Sure, I still struggled with CSS (probably because I didn‚Äôt learn it from a great source), but HTML I had learned well.

Now, I‚Äôve moved on to learning everything else in the JavaScript family: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and more.
And my love for JavaScript?
It‚Äôs only getting stronger ‚Äî no matter what my colleagues or friends say.
They tell me:
*"JavaScript is too hard. None of us could even finish learning it. How could you?"*

But the truth is‚Ä¶
When you love something, the challenge doesn‚Äôt scare you ‚Äî it inspires you.

### How TypeScript Changed My Journey as a Developer

I always wanted to learn TypeScript ‚Äî but procrastination kept stopping me. It was one of those things I knew I should do, yet I kept pushing it aside.

Then, in one of my university classes ‚Äî *Design and Implementation of Programming Languages* ‚Äî my professor announced that everyone would have to give a presentation on a programming language. Naturally, I wanted to choose JavaScript. But the professor started from the left side of the class, and of course, I was sitting on the far right. By the time it was my turn, all the popular languages were already taken: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Swift, R, Go, Dart‚Ä¶ everything.

When it came to me, I asked:
*"Can I choose a framework, like React?"*
The professor shook his head. *‚ÄúNo, only languages.‚Äù*

At that moment, something inside me said: *‚ÄúThis is your chance.‚Äù*
I had always been curious about TypeScript, and deep down, I wanted to challenge myself. So I said: *‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll choose TypeScript.‚Äù*
He nodded in approval.

I had five weeks to prepare.

During those weeks, I poured my heart into the presentation. I designed a Canva template that I‚Äôm still proud of [you can see it here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGlk8BaHZE/GGKK8cesGXbvxn1vQoMGmw/edit?utm_content=DAGlk8BaHZE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton), I read countless documents, and I even refactored some of my old Vanilla JS and React projects into TypeScript.

But preparation wasn‚Äôt just about coding. I wanted to deliver something truly memorable.
I‚Äôve always believed I have strong soft skills, and presenting with confidence is one of them. My goal wasn‚Äôt just to *teach* TypeScript ‚Äî it was to *inspire*.

And when the day came‚Ä¶ it worked.

The professor, who is known for being extremely strict, usually finds mistakes in every presentation. He challenges every line, every explanation, every single detail. Most of my classmates struggled under his questions.

But I had practiced differently. I had described his behavior to ChatGPT and told it: *‚ÄúPretend you are my professor. Be as cruel as possible. Ask me every hard question you can think of.‚Äù*
So by the time I stood in front of the class, I was ready for him.

Every tough question he asked, I answered calmly and professionally. And when it was over, he said something I‚Äôll never forget:

*‚ÄúIf I give others 2 points, I‚Äôll give you 2 plus. Your presentation was on another level.‚Äù*

That day wasn‚Äôt just about earning a grade. It was about proving to myself that I could face a challenge, step out of my comfort zone, and master something new.

And that‚Äôs how TypeScript became not just another tool in my developer journey ‚Äî but a turning point in how I approach learning, growth, and confidence as a programmer.

## Falling in Love with React

Like many JavaScript developers, I jumped into React right after finishing the basics of JS. Honestly, it was a bit rushed ‚Äî I dove straight into Jonas Schmedtmann‚Äôs **React + Redux** course on Udemy. The course was excellent, but to be honest, I never actually finished it.

Instead, I got the chance to join a local startup at my university, where I learned React through practice and real-world projects. That hands-on experience turned out to be even more valuable. Thanks to the foundation I had from Jonas‚Äôs course, I could combine what I learned from the documentation with actual project work.

Sometimes I wonder if I should have completed the entire course ‚Äî especially since Jonas later updated it to include **Next.js**. But there‚Äôs no going back. Over time, my learning style shifted. I no longer enjoy watching hours of long video tutorials. Instead, I find myself more comfortable and satisfied with reading documentation and building things directly.

Looking ahead, I definitely want to deepen my knowledge of **Redux** and dive further into **Next.js** (I‚Äôll write more about that in a future post üòâ).

One thing I‚Äôll never forget from that startup was how strongly they insisted I switch to **Vue.js** or even **Dart**, just to make the project move faster. But my love for React wouldn‚Äôt let me. I didn‚Äôt want to abandon it ‚Äî and honestly, I‚Äôm glad I stayed true to it.

## Why I Use TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that redefines the way developers approach styling. Instead of writing long custom CSS files and switching constantly between HTML and CSS, Tailwind allows you to style elements directly in your markup using small, composable utility classes.

At first, the long class names may look intimidating, but once you get used to them, development becomes much faster and smoother. You no longer need to come up with new class names or worry about overriding styles ‚Äî everything is applied right where you need it.

### Why TailwindCSS Stands Out
- **Speed:** No more writing repetitive CSS or jumping between files.  
- **Consistency:** Tailwind provides a predefined design system with spacing, colors, and typography.  
- **Customization:** The \`tailwind.config.js\` file gives you full control to extend themes and add your own utilities.  
- **Responsive by default:** Breakpoints are built in, so handling responsive design feels effortless.  
- **Smaller production builds:** With Tailwind‚Äôs purge feature, unused CSS is automatically removed.  

### Tailwind vs Traditional Frameworks
Unlike frameworks such as Bootstrap, Tailwind doesn‚Äôt lock you into pre-made components with a ‚Äúframework look.‚Äù Instead, it gives you the building blocks to create **your own unique design** faster ‚Äî without fighting against predefined styles.

### My Experience with Tailwind
After using Tailwind on several projects, I noticed a big shift in how I write CSS. Styling feels more like building with Lego blocks: simple, reusable, and efficient. It fits especially well with **React** and **Next.js**, since styles live right next to components.  

For me, TailwindCSS has been more than just a framework ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a productivity booster. It makes styling feel natural and keeps me focused on what matters most: building great user experiences.

## How I Learned Node.js and Realized My Potential

The story of how I learned Node.js starts with the city I live in. In my current city, there are almost no programming jobs. Companies mostly use WordPress, and honestly‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not my style. I‚Äôve always been drawn to real coding, building things from scratch, not just customizing templates.

Back when I was living in Mashhad, I had the chance to join an internship. But that summer, I couldn‚Äôt go back to Mashhad to participate in most internships. The only available position that fit me was a backend internship, and it required learning things I hadn‚Äôt touched much before: Node.js, GitHub, Git, MongoDB, and SQL.

Determined to qualify, I dove headfirst into learning all of them. I remember spending two or three weeks just practicing, watching tutorials, reading documentation, and experimenting with small projects. At first, it felt overwhelming, but soon I realized something incredible: I could actually learn all this in such a short time. For me, that was huge. I‚Äôve always been a bit lazy with other courses or topics, but here I felt unstoppable.

When the time came for the interview, I got some disappointing news. They said I was still halfway through my bachelor‚Äôs degree, and since I didn‚Äôt live in the city permanently, they couldn‚Äôt hire me after the internship. I had lost the opportunity.  

But instead of feeling defeated, I felt proud. I had proven to myself that I could learn an entirely new stack‚ÄîNode.js, databases, Git, and GitHub‚Äîin just a couple of weeks. That moment gave me confidence. I realized that if I put my mind to something, I could achieve far more than I had ever thought possible.

Since then, I‚Äôve kept building on that foundation. I practice regularly, explore new tools, and take on small projects. That summer taught me something even more important than Node.js: I can learn anything, as long as I really want to. And sometimes, the challenges that seem frustrating at first end up being the most rewarding lessons of all.

export const blogPost006Text = `## Discovering Next.js: From React to Real Projects

After spending a good amount of time learning and practicing React, it felt like the natural next step was to explore **Next.js**. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt start with long courses or tutorials. Instead, I decided to dive in through actual projects ‚Äî the kind of hands-on experience that forces you to learn fast, make mistakes, and figure things out.

My portfolio itself became my first real playground for Next.js. I wanted to understand how React could work together with server-side rendering, routing, and static generation. At first, it was confusing ‚Äî the concepts were new, and sometimes I wasn‚Äôt sure how to organize the project properly. But I found that reading the **official documentation** carefully and experimenting alongside was surprisingly effective.

I‚Äôll be honest: I still feel like a junior beginner. There are moments when I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm doing something the ‚Äúbest‚Äù way, or when a small mistake breaks the layout or functionality. But that‚Äôs part of the learning process, and I try to embrace it. Each bug I fix and each feature I implement teaches me something new about how Next.js works under the hood.

One thing I really appreciate about learning this way is that I‚Äôm not just memorizing commands or following instructions step by step. I‚Äôm actually **building things**, seeing results immediately, and understanding why each decision matters. That makes the whole experience feel much more real and rewarding than passively watching videos.

Looking forward, I know I still have a lot to explore ‚Äî advanced routing, data fetching, optimizations, and integrating it with TypeScript. But for now, I‚Äôm happy taking it one project at a time, learning organically, and slowly gaining confidence.

Next.js may still be new to me, but I feel like I‚Äôm finally starting to see how it fits into my workflow as a React developer. And even as a beginner, I can already appreciate the power and flexibility it brings to building modern web apps.
