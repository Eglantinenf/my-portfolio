## My Journey to Finding My Love for Coding

I started my Computer Engineering degree in September 2022.
Like most students in my program, the first language they taught us was C++.
But honestly… I didn’t like it at all. It just didn’t click with me.

Around that time, social media was full of people saying, "Python is the best language to start with!"
So, I decided to give it a try. I jumped from one Python course to another — four different courses in a single year — hoping to finally connect with it.
Eventually, I thought, "Alright, maybe Django is the next step."
But I hated it. I mean… really **hated** it.

I was completely lost. I didn’t know what direction to take anymore.
I couldn’t write code without relying on AI to basically do it for me.
By July 2023, I decided to quit Python altogether.

I reached out to several “successful” programmers for advice.
But instead of guiding me selflessly, most of them tried to push me toward their own paths, their own languages, or even their own work projects.
That wasn’t what I wanted.
I wasn’t looking for someone else’s dream — I wanted to find *my* dream.
I wanted to discover a programming language I could truly fall in love with.

After a month away from coding, I told myself:
*"Come on, Nastaran… at least learn HTML. It’s better than nothing. No matter which language you end up using, HTML will be useful."*

So, I opened YouTube, found the **Bro Code** HTML course, and started.
To my surprise… I found it *incredibly* interesting!
Naturally, the next step was styling.
I told myself:
*"It’s just a 6-hour CSS course, Nastaran. Don’t be lazy. You can do this."*

I finished the CSS course in a single day.
And I loved every second of it.

Then I started doing small HTML + CSS projects I found on YouTube.
But many of them needed a bit of JavaScript for buttons or animations.
In the videos, the creators would say:
*"Don’t worry about learning this part — just copy the <script></script> code."*

But I didn’t want to just copy it.
I wanted to *understand* it.

That’s when I found a **90-hour JavaScript course** on an Iranian platform called **SabzLearn**.
It was divided into three parts: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.
The beginner section was only 10 hours, so I thought:
*"Perfect. This should cover all the basics I need for those small projects."*

But by the end of that week… I was already halfway through the intermediate section.
I had fallen *completely* in love with JavaScript.

I loved everything about it — the logic, the creativity, the possibilities.
Sure, I still struggled with CSS (probably because I didn’t learn it from a great source), but HTML I had learned well.

Now, I’ve moved on to learning everything else in the JavaScript family: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and more.
And my love for JavaScript?
It’s only getting stronger — no matter what my colleagues or friends say.
They tell me:
*"JavaScript is too hard. None of us could even finish learning it. How could you?"*

But the truth is…
When you love something, the challenge doesn’t scare you — it inspires you.

### How TypeScript Changed My Journey as a Developer

I always wanted to learn TypeScript — but procrastination kept stopping me. It was one of those things I knew I should do, yet I kept pushing it aside.

Then, in one of my university classes — *Design and Implementation of Programming Languages* — my professor announced that everyone would have to give a presentation on a programming language. Naturally, I wanted to choose JavaScript. But the professor started from the left side of the class, and of course, I was sitting on the far right. By the time it was my turn, all the popular languages were already taken: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Swift, R, Go, Dart… everything.

When it came to me, I asked:
*"Can I choose a framework, like React?"*
The professor shook his head. *“No, only languages.”*

At that moment, something inside me said: *“This is your chance.”*
I had always been curious about TypeScript, and deep down, I wanted to challenge myself. So I said: *“Then I’ll choose TypeScript.”*
He nodded in approval.

I had five weeks to prepare.

During those weeks, I poured my heart into the presentation. I designed a Canva template that I’m still proud of [you can see it here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGlk8BaHZE/GGKK8cesGXbvxn1vQoMGmw/edit?utm_content=DAGlk8BaHZE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton), I read countless documents, and I even refactored some of my old Vanilla JS and React projects into TypeScript.

But preparation wasn’t just about coding. I wanted to deliver something truly memorable.
I’ve always believed I have strong soft skills, and presenting with confidence is one of them. My goal wasn’t just to *teach* TypeScript — it was to *inspire*.

And when the day came… it worked.

The professor, who is known for being extremely strict, usually finds mistakes in every presentation. He challenges every line, every explanation, every single detail. Most of my classmates struggled under his questions.

But I had practiced differently. I had described his behavior to ChatGPT and told it: *“Pretend you are my professor. Be as cruel as possible. Ask me every hard question you can think of.”*
So by the time I stood in front of the class, I was ready for him.

Every tough question he asked, I answered calmly and professionally. And when it was over, he said something I’ll never forget:

*“If I give others 2 points, I’ll give you 2 plus. Your presentation was on another level.”*

That day wasn’t just about earning a grade. It was about proving to myself that I could face a challenge, step out of my comfort zone, and master something new.

And that’s how TypeScript became not just another tool in my developer journey — but a turning point in how I approach learning, growth, and confidence as a programmer.

## Falling in Love with React

Like many JavaScript developers, I jumped into React right after finishing the basics of JS. Honestly, it was a bit rushed — I dove straight into Jonas Schmedtmann’s **React + Redux** course on Udemy. The course was excellent, but to be honest, I never actually finished it.

Instead, I got the chance to join a local startup at my university, where I learned React through practice and real-world projects. That hands-on experience turned out to be even more valuable. Thanks to the foundation I had from Jonas’s course, I could combine what I learned from the documentation with actual project work.

Sometimes I wonder if I should have completed the entire course — especially since Jonas later updated it to include **Next.js**. But there’s no going back. Over time, my learning style shifted. I no longer enjoy watching hours of long video tutorials. Instead, I find myself more comfortable and satisfied with reading documentation and building things directly.

Looking ahead, I definitely want to deepen my knowledge of **Redux** and dive further into **Next.js** (I’ll write more about that in a future post 😉).

One thing I’ll never forget from that startup was how strongly they insisted I switch to **Vue.js** or even **Dart**, just to make the project move faster. But my love for React wouldn’t let me. I didn’t want to abandon it — and honestly, I’m glad I stayed true to it.
